# GitHub Copilot Setup for Quiz App

## Overview
This project includes comprehensive GitHub Copilot instructions to help maintain code consistency, follow best practices, and accelerate development while preserving the app's architecture and design patterns.

## Files Created

### 1. `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
**Main instruction file** - Contains detailed guidelines for:
- Project structure and architecture
- Coding standards and conventions
- Component patterns and templates
- Firebase integration patterns
- Styling guidelines with Tailwind CSS
- Internationalization requirements
- Security and performance considerations

### 2. `.copilotrc.md`
**Quick reference file** - Contains:
- Concise templates for common patterns
- Key technologies and preferences
- Do's and don'ts for code generation
- Common patterns to follow/avoid

### 3. `.vscode/settings.json`
**VS Code specific settings** - Configures:
- Copilot enablement for file types
- Suggestion counts and lengths
- Language preferences

## How to Use

### For GitHub Copilot Chat
1. **Reference the instructions**: Start conversations with:
   ```
   @workspace Based on the project's Copilot instructions, help me create...
   ```

2. **Context-aware requests**: Use specific terminology from the instructions:
   ```
   Create a new quiz component following our component patterns with Polish text
   ```

3. **Enforce patterns**: Copilot will automatically suggest code that follows:
   - Component structure templates
   - Direct Polish text usage
   - Firebase service patterns
   - Responsive design principles

### For Inline Suggestions
- Copilot will suggest code that follows the established patterns
- Variable names and structure will align with project conventions
- Import statements will follow the specified order
- Styling will use the semantic color tokens

### For New Features
When creating new features, Copilot will automatically:
- Include proper error handling
- Add loading states
- Use direct Polish text instead of translation keys
- Follow mobile-first responsive design
- Implement proper Firebase service layer patterns

## Key Benefits

1. **Consistency**: All generated code follows the same patterns
2. **Best Practices**: Built-in security, accessibility, and performance considerations
3. **Polish-Only**: Direct Polish text usage without translation system
4. **Mobile-First**: Responsive design by default
5. **Firebase Integration**: Proper service layer patterns
6. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management

## Customization

To modify the instructions:

1. **Update patterns**: Edit `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for detailed changes
2. **Quick tweaks**: Edit `.copilotrc.md` for immediate preferences
3. **VS Code settings**: Modify `.vscode/settings.json` for editor behavior

## Examples

### Creating a New Component
```
@workspace Create a UserAchievements component that displays user badges and progress
```
Copilot will generate a component that:
- Uses the standard component structure
- Includes direct Polish text
- Follows responsive design patterns
- Uses semantic color classes
- Includes proper error handling

### Adding a New Service
```
@workspace Create a badgeService for managing user achievements in Firebase
```
Copilot will generate a service that:
- Follows the Firebase service pattern
- Includes proper error handling
- Uses consistent naming conventions
- Includes all CRUD operations

### Building Forms
```
@workspace Create a quiz settings form with validation
```
Copilot will generate a form that:
- Uses React Hook Form
- Includes proper validation
- Uses direct Polish error messages
- Follows responsive design
- Includes loading states

## Project-Specific Features

The instructions are tailored for this quiz app's specific needs:
- **Quiz Management**: Patterns for quiz creation, editing, and playing
- **User Progress**: Streak tracking and achievement systems
- **Gamification**: Progress bars, levels, and rewards
- **Polish-Only Interface**: Direct Polish text without translation system
- **Firebase Integration**: Authentication, Firestore, and Storage
- **Design System**: Consistent UI components and styling

## Troubleshooting

If Copilot suggestions don't follow the patterns:
1. Check that the instruction files are in the correct locations
2. Restart VS Code to reload the configuration
3. Use more specific prompts that reference the instructions
4. Ensure you're using `@workspace` in chat conversations

## Future Updates

As the project evolves:
1. Update the instruction files with new patterns
2. Add new component templates as needed
3. Refine the guidelines based on development experience
4. Keep the quick reference file current with changes

The instructions will help maintain code quality and consistency as the team grows and the application develops.
